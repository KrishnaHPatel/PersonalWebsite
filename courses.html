			<!-- Content -->
			<section id="content" class="main">
				<h2>CS 2110: Object-Oriented Programming & Data Structures</h2>
				<p>Learned intermediate programming in Java, including object-oriented principles (classes, inheritance,
					polymorphism), algorithm analysis, recursion, and various data structures such as lists, trees, and hash
					tables. Gained experience in building event-driven GUIs and understanding concurrent programming.</p>

				<h2>CS 2800: Discrete Structures</h2>
				<p>Covered essential mathematical concepts for computer science, such as logical proofs, set theory,
					combinatorics, graph theory, and basic probability. Applied these concepts to various computer science
					problems.</p>

				<h2>CS 3110: Data Structures & Functional Programming</h2>
				<p>Focused on advanced programming with an emphasis on functional programming techniques, recursive and
					higher-order procedures, and data structures like balanced trees and heaps. Analyzed program performance and
					correctness.</p>

				<h2>CS 4320: Introduction to Database Systems</h2>
				<p>Explored modern database systems, covering data models, query languages, database design, storage structures,
					query processing, and transaction management in both relational and non-relational databases.</p>

				<h2>CS 4780: Introduction to Machine Learning</h2>
				<p>Introduced to machine learning concepts with a focus on supervised learning. Studied linear models, deep
					networks, boosting, and ethical considerations in ML applications.</p>

				<h2>CS 4820: Introduction to the Analysis of Algorithms</h2>
				<p>Developed techniques for designing and analyzing algorithms, with topics including greedy algorithms, dynamic
					programming, NP-completeness, and approximation algorithms. Applied these techniques to real-world computing
					problems.</p>

				<h2>MATH 1920: Multivariable Calculus</h2>
				<p>Learned about partial derivatives, multiple integrals, vector fields, and important theorems like Green's,
					Stokes', and the divergence theorem, which are fundamental for understanding physical phenomena and
					engineering problems.</p>

				<h2>MATH 2930: Differential Equations</h2>
				<p>Studied both ordinary and partial differential equations, covering methods for solving them and applications
					in modeling physical systems, such as population dynamics and heat conduction.</p>

				<h2>MATH 2940: Linear Algebra</h2>
				<p>Focused on matrices, determinants, vector spaces, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors, with applications to Markov
					chains and linear differential equations. Explored the use of linear algebra in computational problems.</p>

				<h2>PHYS 1112: Mechanics & Heat</h2>
				<p>Covered fundamental concepts in mechanics, including kinematics, dynamics, conservation laws, and
					thermodynamics. Emphasized understanding through interactive and problem-solving approaches.</p>

				<h2>PHYS 2213: Electromagnetism</h2>
				<p>Explored electric and magnetic forces, fields, potentials, and circuits, along with Maxwell's equations.
					Applied advanced mathematical techniques like vector calculus to solve physics problems.</p>
